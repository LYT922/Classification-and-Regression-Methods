ML-Classification and Regression Methods
The goal of this assignment is to practice implementing logistic classification and understanding the practical implementation of different regression models. Apply these methods to solve the tasks based on the real-world datasets.
For this assignment, scikit-learn or any other libraries with in-built functions that help to implement ML methods cannot be used. Submissions with used ML libraries (e.g. scikit- learn) will not be evaluated.
